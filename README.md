## âœ¨ Features

- **Add Mentor**: Admin can use the add mentor functionality to add new mentors.
- **Assign Students**: Mentors can add students to be evaluated, ensuring that each mentor accommodates a minimum of 3 and a maximum of 4 students at a time.
- **Assign Marks**: Mentors can assign marks to each student based on various parameters such as ideation, execution, viva/pitch, and more. Total marks are calculated and visible to the mentor.
